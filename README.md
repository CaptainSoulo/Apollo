# Reporting Bugs (And asking for help!)
If you have found a bug or are crashing with unexpected behavior. Please search the issue tracker first before making a new issue.
Otherwise, please use a similar format with your title: '[BUG] Iron Armor recipe result is cake!' or '[REQUEST] Ender Dragons For Every Man!'
I will have a base issue called '[TEMPLATE] Issue Template' that will give your issue a solid format to work with and allow us to resolve your request faster and easier!

Minor issues such has "How do I blah blah blah blah?" can be redirected to my Discord (which at the time of writing is not available quite yet. Soon though!)

# Donations / Money
I never expected to be given donations or money for making Apollo, I just wanted a beautiful, challenging and fun experience making & playing a modpack and this modpack is tailored to the exact way I've always wanted to play Minecraft, within reason of course. If you do feel inclined to send donations, send them to my PayPal account below or become a Patron of mine and I'll make sure it'll be worth your while somehow! '(also not available at the time of writing. I wasn't ready for all of this! Dx)'
